# Homework 2

**1.** **Yes**

The operation corresponds to an [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or). For being a group it has to satisfy the following conditions and it does:

- Closure
- Identity
- Commutativity
- Inverses
- Associativity

A more detail explanation is [here](https://cafe.elharo.com/math/xor-defines-an-abelian-group/)

**2. a)** True

Examples:

1² mod 8 = 1
3² mod 8 = 1
5² mod 8 = 1
7² mod 8 = 1
9² mod 8 = 1

**2. b)** False

Counterexample: 2² mod 8 = 4

**3.** We have to use vanity address [with caution](https://cryptopotato.com/profanity-exploit-continues-as-hackers-drain-another-732-eth-from-crypto-wallet/)

**4.** 

- O(n): complexity increases linearly, like a `for` statement with variable assignments
- O(1): complexity is constant, like assigning a variable
- O(log n): complexity increases logarithmically, as for example when you divide the structure in half over and over again and do a constant number of operations for each split

**5.** 

The best one would be O(1), as the complexity doesn't increase if the input vary in size.
